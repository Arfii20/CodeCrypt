# Encryption-Decryption

#### Made an encryption and decryption program using java and javafx
### I made my own algorithm which asks for an integer (any integer) from the user and uses that to encrypt
<br>

## For Encryption:
#### The integer provided by the user is used to get unique 5 digit values for each character and returns a long String containing only numbers. 
#### The user copy the Encrypted String to his clipboard.
<br>

## For Decryption:
#### The user needs to enter that exact integer which he entered while encrypting to decrypt the number string. 
#### The user copy the Decrypted String to his clipboard.

<br>

### The algorithm produces unique values for each character for each integer. No one can decrypt the Number String without knowing the seed that was used to encrypt

<br>

#### Did this mainly to learn javafx and javafxml. This is my first gui application of java.
